  The ChimeraTK Watchdog is an application for system
  monitoring and process control and monitoring for Linux
  based operating systems. It is an C++ application, which
  is based on the ChimeraTK framework. Thanks to the
  framework it can make use of the different control system
  adapters available in ChimeraTK, which means it can become
  e.g a Tango server, EPICS IOC , OPC UA server and so on.
