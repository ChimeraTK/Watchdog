/**
 * \brief Handler used to start and stop processes.
 *
 * Use the Handler only to start a single process.
 * When a process is started fork + execv is used. The parent
 * process does not know the child process and its pid. Therefore,
 * the child creates a file that contains the PID. The parent
 * process reads the PID from that file.
 * The file is created in the /tmp directory of the system.
 * In case the system reboots /tmp is cleaned and therefor it can not
 * happen, that the PID read from the PID file is given to another process
 * after system boot. The file is also deleted if the started process
 * is killed using killProcess. Else the file is not deleted.
 * If e.g. the watchdog is killed, the process that was started before
 * by its ProcessHandler can not be terminated and could still be running.
 * In that case the pid file indicates that. If the watchdog constructs a
 * new ProcessHandler it will realize during construction that the PID is still
 * present and it will check if the process is still running.
 * If the ProcessHandler is destroyed a check is performed
 * if a process with the stored pid is still running.
 * If this is the case it is killed. First the process is killed using SIGINT
 * and if that fails SIGKILL is used.
 *
 * \attention Use the setupHandler() function once to define a handler for the
 * SIGCHLD signal!
